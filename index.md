    Cambridge University India Society was founded by India’s first Prime Minister, the great Jawaharlal Nehru, during his time at Trinity College. It was set up to facilitate greater understanding of Indian culture within Cambridge, and serves as a dynamic social platform for both Indian and non-Indian students alike.</p>
    <p style="margin-top:20px">
    We hope to raise awareness of cultural and political issues relating to India through our events such as academics talks, classes, film nights. We also host a variety of social events including club nights, formals, sports events, our annual garden party and of course, our legendary Annual Ball.</p>
    <p style="margin-top:20px">
    We are open to all students, regardless of race or religion - all you need is an interest in all things Indian! From fascinating guest speakers, to exciting social events, we have something for everyone.
